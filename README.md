# 🌐 **Global Superstore Dashboard**

## 🔍 **Project Overview**
This project analyses the performance of a global retail store chain. Using Microsoft Excel for data preparation and Tableau for data visualization, I transformed raw sales and profit data into an interactive dashboard that reveals key business insights across various regions, product categories, and customer segments. 📊✨

The dashboard visualizes:

- **Sales and profit trends** across different regions and countries.
- **Top-performing product categories** and sub-categories.
- **Customer segment insights** based on profitability.
- **Geospatial distribution** of sales performance on a world map.
